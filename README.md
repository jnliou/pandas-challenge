# pandas-challenge
Purpose: In this analysis, we were applying the knowledge we learned about with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school and standardized test data. The objective of this challenge was to provide insights and trends in school performance to assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding school budgets and priorities.

Instructions: 
Open up the main.ipynb file on Juptyer notebook found in the folder: pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools/main.ipynb.
Run the code, and you'll be able to see my analysis for: district summary, school summary, highest-performing schools by percentage of overall passing, lowest-performing schools by percentage of overall passing, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 

Ensure your terminal is on pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools/Resources, so that the code can run properly and read the schools_complete and students_complete csv files that we are merging. 

For the written analysis component of the challenge, open up "School Data Written Analysis.docx" found in the pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools folder.
